            Ever feel like you’re keeping score of the times life’s knocked you down? 
            Or how you just can’t catch a break? It’s something a lot of us go through. 
            Work problems, relationship issues, or just feeling plain lonely—it’s a lot. 
            And sometimes, it gets tougher when you scroll through Instagram and see everyone 
            else seemingly living their best life.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve been there, thinking I'm way behind my friends. Their posts with perfect smiles and epic adventures can make anyone feel they’ve got it all. 
            But here's the thing, after some heart-to-hearts with them, I realized those smiles aren't telling the whole story. Turns out, not everything 
            is as perfect as it looks on a screen. It’s kind of like Instagram’s got this unspoken rule: only show the highlight reel.
       </p>

       <p>
        So here I am, typing this out from a hospital room, hoping to share a bit of real talk.
        This isn’t to bring you down, but to say it's okay if everything isn't picture-perfect. 
        Next time you're scrolling and start to feel that green-eyed monster, hit the pause button. 
        Who knows what’s really going on behind that post?
       </p>

       <p>The point is: <span class="highlight">be easy on yourself. Tackle your problems one at a time. And hey, if you 
        can, do something nice for someone. It might not seem like much, but it can make a big difference.
         Life’s tough, but so are you. And sometimes, a small act of kindness is all it takes to turn things around.</span></p>
