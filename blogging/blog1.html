        I had always wanted to write about my journey to Bangladesh, but I wasn't sure where to start. 
        I finally decided to create my own website, where I could share my story with the world. 
        It took some extra time and effort,  but it was definitely worth it. As I look back my journey to Bangladesh, 
        I find myself looking back on an extraordinary journey. A trip that has left an indelible mark on my heart and soul. 

        <br>
        <br>

        As the final semester of my undergraduate studies commenced in early 2023, a mixture of excitement  enveloped me.
        I was anticipating completing my undergraduate degree in a few months, and I was comforted by the knowledge that
        I had a job offer pending after graduation. But beyond this milestone, an even more profound thrill awaited: the 
        prospect of returning to Bangladesh, the place where I spent my childhood and where my family, friends, and relatives 
        awaited for my arrival.

        <br>
        <br> 
        The thought of reuniting with familiar faces after such a significant time gap filled me with both joy and trepidation.
        Would they recognize me? Would I recognize them? These questions lingered in my mind, but they couldn't dim the excitement of revisiting the place that had left an indelible mark on my heart and soul.

        <br>
        <br>
        Making the decision to embark on this journey was not without challenges. 
        I was in the middle of my final semester, and I was concerned about missing classes
         and unfinished assignments. As an intern at my workplace, I was also anxious about requesting 
         a 15-day leave. I wondered how my manager would react and how I would catch up with my work after
        a few weeks of break. Despite these worries, the day I had eagerly been waiting for finally arrived on March 13.

        <br>
        <br> 
        As I prepared to leave, the rush of last-minute gift shopping kept me so busy that I had forgotten to measure my baggage. 
        Thankfully, my student status allowed me to carry extra luggage on Qatar Airways, but it took some maneuvering to find the
        perfect balance of 23 kg for each piece of luggage during the check-in process.

        <br> 
        <br> 
        The clock struck 7.00 pm, and the plane gracefully took off from Chicago. 
        I stole one last look through the window, bidding farewell to the city that 
        would welcome me back in just 12 days. On board, I found myself in conversation 
        with an intriguing mid-aged traveler, well-versed in Indian culture and traditions. 
        As we engaged, I couldn't help but feel slightly embarrassed by my lack of knowledge 
        about certain aspects of India. Nonetheless, his stories added a fascinating layer to my journey.
        <br>
        <br> 
        As the clock struck 11.00 pm in Doha and 2.00 am in Bangladesh,
        my connecting flight to Dhaka began its journey. I found myself 
        seated next to a middle-aged person who had left Bangladesh long 
        ago but was now traveling back for a short visit. We delved into 
        topics ranging from his past involvement with the Bangladesh military 
        to corruption issues, but I found myself dozing off, not particularly 
        interested in those discussions. When I woke, the airplane dashboard showed 
        I was just about 30 minutes away from arriving in Dhaka. Looking at the sunshine
        from the airplane window filled me with nostalgia.

    <p> As the airplane doors opened, releasing a gust of warm, humid air,
         I slowly stepped into Bangladesh, the land of my childhood memories
          and long-lost connections. With excitement and anticipation coursing 
          through my veins, I collected all my luggage and headed towards the 
          immigration counter. A gentle smile from the immigration officer welcomed me, and 
          I couldn't help but wonder if my US passport played a role in the warm reception. 
          Observing the scene on the opposite side, where fellow Bangladeshi passport holders 
          faced stern questioning, a bittersweet realization of passport privilege washed over me.</p>

    <p>Finally completing the immigration process, 
       I made my way to the domestic flight area to catch 
       my next journey, soaring from Dhaka to Sylhet. The 
       flight to Sylhet was short but sweet, and as the plane 
       descended over the lush green landscapes, my heart raced 
       with excitement. Stepping onto Sylhet's soil, I was greeted 
       with warm embraces from my brother and Sadeq mama, who had been 
       eagerly waiting for my arrival. But the ultimate delight came when
        I reunited with my best friends, Tabshir, Nadel, and Hasnat.  </p>

     <p>After reaching home, I didn't really rest as I had many tasks to do, especially with my brother's wedding just a few days away.</p>
     
     
     <p>
        During my short time in Bangladesh, I had the privilege of attending three weddings and a gaye holud ceremony, as well as visiting many relatives' houses and spending a good amount of time with friends and family. 
        Among all the experiences, one journey left an indelible mark on my heart – a visit to my village house, where I spent my formative years. The village lies about 80 km north of Sylhet, nestled between latitudes 24°51'
        and 25°00' north, and longitudes 92°13' and 92°30' east. (Zokigong, Pillakandi, Tafadar Bari). On that day, my companions were my mom and dad. We decided to rent a car and set off on our journey early in the morning. 
        As we traversed the narrow, one-way road, the sight of cows leisurely strolling and women diligently drying unmilled rice along the edges of lush fields filled me with a mix of familiarity. It had been nearly a decade since
         my last visit, but the memories of this route remained vivid in my mind. We saw elderly folks gracefully walking along the road, some shirtless but  have a widen smiles. Throughout the day, I was fortunate enough to visit some
        significant places that held profound meaning in my life. I went to meet Mohodissab, a revered Imam in the area. Then, we made our way to my boro fufu's house and my kala house and later on to my nana bari. Despite the shortage of time, I was also able to perform Ziyarah for my grandfather, grandmother, and my kala.   It was about 10.00 pm when we return back to Sylhet and as I  head to bed to rest 
        the realization that came to my mind  where I am from, where I am and my deeply rooted  love for those place.

        Additionally, I found myself chatting with someone a lot more than I had expected. There were nights when our conversations lasted until 2.00 am. Perhaps, there was something I didn't fully realize at the time. Why did I chat with that person so much? That is something I will write about on a different day. I must say that person was sweet and had such a kind heart, and a I learned a lot of things. Perhaps, it's fair to say she has changed my thinking process in some way..
     </p>
    
    <p>As my 10 days short trip came to end and I prepare to return, I know that I may not see many of the same faces when I come back. 
        Some will be busy with their lives, and with some, I may lose touch and some will set their life in different country where I may not get time to visit. And sadly, some may have passed away.
         But until next time, Bangladesh, until we meet again.</p>

     <br> 
     <strong>  I owe a great deal to my friends, Tabshir, Nadel, Hasnat, Sadiya, and Salma, who spent a lot of time with me and made 
        my experience in Bangladesh truly exceptional</strong>
